This code implements some sort of weird algebraic formula whose purpose doesn't matter.

Look through main.c (***but do not edit at all***) and at the top you will see teacher_calc().

Figure out how it works, and then you will need to implement it in assembly in student_calc.s

Use the makefile to build the project, don't compile it directly. (Just type "mk" or "make".)

Your code is correct when your assembly generates the same results as the teacher_calc function.
