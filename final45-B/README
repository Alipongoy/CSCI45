Final45-B: FINAL WORDS Assignment

This is a pretty easy assignment, it is really to get you to think about the words of a famous philosopher as you exit our computer science program and move on to the greater world abroad.

The coding is simple, you will use the WRITE SYSCALL (not printf or cout, etc.) to print to the screen the following text (including the newlines exactly as shown):

MONETARY STATUS is not what matters (but it helps) -
A man is MEASURED by the way that he THINKS
not clothing lines, ice memes, mudkips, and minks.
I spent 20 plus years SEEKING KNOWLEDGE itself.
So live life for LIFE, and not for wealth.

Note: build your project using "make" (or "mk"). You cannot use anything other than assembly.
